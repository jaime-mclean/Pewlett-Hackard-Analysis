## Overview

---
Employee turnover can be highly detrimental to business. As long-time employees approach retirement age, the need to disseminate the institutional knowledge they possess becomes more urgent. The loss of institutional knowledge can negatively impact productivity, so it is important to understand how many employees may leave if an early retirement package is offered, and have a continuity plan to make sure that critical knowledge is not lost.

## Summary

---
While turnover is inevitable in any company, large-scale losses are difficult for any company to absorb. The number of retirement-eligible employees is far greater than what can be replaced with the mentorship-eligible employees. I would recommend expanding mentorship eligibility to create additional mentoring capacity.
